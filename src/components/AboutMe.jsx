            {/* <p className="mt-5 font-medium text-xl text-center ">a Front-End Developer with over three years of experience building fast, responsive, and user-centric web applications. <br />

                I specialize in Vue.js, React, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS (or other UI frameworks), RESTful APIs, and responsive web design. My technical toolkit also includes version control (Git/GitHub) and modern development tools like Vite and Pinia. Iâ€™ve successfully developed and maintained several Single Page Applications (SPAs) that emphasize performance, scalability, and seamless user experiences. <br />

                I was deeply involved in the full product lifecycleâ€”from ideation to deployment. I led the development of multiple web platforms, collaborated cross-functionally with product and design teams, and ensured clean code practices through proper version control and documentation. <br />

                Beyond technical skills, Iâ€™m passionate about continuous learning, open communication, and collaborative problem-solving. I believe these values are essential to creating effective and innovative digital solutions.
